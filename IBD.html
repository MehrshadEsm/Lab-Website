      <p>IBD, including Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, affects millions of people worldwide, causing debilitating symptoms and significantly impacting quality of life. Conventional treatments often provide only temporary relief and may come with significant side effects. At BC Children's Research Institute, we are revolutionizing IBD treatment through the development of cutting-edge cellular therapies.</p>

      <p>By leveraging the remarkable regenerative potential of stem cells and the immune-modulating properties of various cell types, we aim to restore intestinal homeostasis and alleviate inflammation in patients with IBD. Our research spans from fundamental investigations into the mechanisms of disease to the translation of novel cellular therapies into clinical practice.</p>
